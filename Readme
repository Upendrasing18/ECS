I have created a basic flask application using Dockerfile.

created pytest.py to build and push the image to ECR, we can assigen tag value also here 

then i have created the terraform scrip that will create the ECS cluster and service, we have to provide the ECR repo name in code 

this above two steps are working correctly i have tested this and task is up and running 

than we can use the ansible playbook to run the terraform script agian for update  

but for ansible playbook the testing part is remaing due to server issues
